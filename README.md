> I'm a computer programmer born in Qatar and grew up in the Philippines. I have a lot of hobbies so much so that I've become too lazy to put them in any about me section of any of my socials. I'm more into graphics programming and visualizations, but I also like logic in general and computers.

## My programming languages tier list
| S | A | B | C | D | Java | Haven't / Want to try | Not a Programming Language |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
